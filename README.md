## Hospital patient accounting system 

**stack: C++/Qt, PostgreSQL**

The system consists of two parts:
- an application for making an appointment to the doctor
- the administration panel

(folders "Cursach" and "Cursach_part2" respectively :P)

The appointment application allows a patient to choose a doctor and a time for an appointment, then writes an appointment to the database and generates an appointment ticked with patient's and doctor's information in it.
It also can update available information about doctors in real time (by clicking the "update" button)

The administration panel provides a functionality to mark any appointment as "attended" and/or delete it from the database (if needed). It also can update the appontment information in real time (by clicking the "update" button).
